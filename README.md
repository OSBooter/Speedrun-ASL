# Speedrun-ASL
My AutoSplitters

# [Treadnauts Target ASL for v1.00](https://github.com/OSBooter/Speedrun-ASL/blob/master/TreadnautsPauser.asl)
+ Splits when selecting the next stage
+ Can pause at results screen
+ Can end time when finishing last level.
--Make sure to use game time if you are using the auto pause after level complete--

# How To Setup
1. You'll need [livesplit](http://livesplit.org/downloads/)

2. You need to set up 40 levels by editing splits or by getting them somewhere, like my run on [Speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/Treadnauts/run/y438kvqz) or [splits.io](https://splits.io/35zt) through open splits by url/speedrun.com

2.5. I guess you could set up *less* levels and uncheck the ones you aren't attempting...

3. You also need to have in your layout the splits, an the Timer, *set to game time for pausing functions/or real time for the RTA category*, and of course the Scriptable Auto Splitter and browse to the downloaded ASL file.

4. Check the features you need and then you are all set! 

5. If your computer breaks... idk, if the code doesn't work **[LET ME KNOW](https://github.com/OSBooter/Speedrun-ASL/issues)**

# Controls
1. I use "enter" as start time/start level and then you can just use 'z' and 'back to menu' to keep using it with auto splitting.

2. When you move to "down" a level, the autosplitter will make a split, this will happen up until the last level where it will split when you break the last target in "Kappa".

3. For now the rules are start the select the level to start the time, though we could just have it start at first input, I haven't found a variable for the in-game timer start so starting earlier lets you retime :).
