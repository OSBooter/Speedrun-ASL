My AutoSplitters

# Treadnauts ASL for v1.00
+ Splits when selecting the next stage
+ Can pause at results screen
+ Can end time when finishing last level.
--Make sure to use game time if you are using the auto pause after level complete--

# How To Use
1. You'll need [livesplit](http://livesplit.org/downloads/)

2. You need to set up 40 levels by editing splits or by getting them somewhere, like my run on [Speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/Treadnauts/run/y438kvqz) through open splits by url/speedrun.com

2.5. I guess you could set up *less* levels and uncheck the ones you aren't attempting...

3. You also need to have in your layout the splits, an the Timer, *set to game time for pausing functions/or real time for the RTA category*, and of course the Scriptable Auto Splitter and browse to the downloaded ASL file.

4. Check the features you need and then you are all set! 

5. If your computer breaks... idk, if the code doesn't work **[LET ME KNOW](https://github.com/OSBooter/Speedrun-ASL/issues)**
